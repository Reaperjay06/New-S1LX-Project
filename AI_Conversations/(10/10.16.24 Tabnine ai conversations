(Me) so i have added the project to a folder name "Pip-Boy-Interface" do i add the SFML library to this folder?

Yes, you can add the SFML library to the "Pip-Boy-Interface" folder. Here's how you can do it:

1. Download the SFML library from https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.html. Choose the version that matches your operating system and compiler (GCC for Linux/macOS, MSVC for Windows).

2. Extract the downloaded SFML package.

3. Copy the "include" folder from the extracted SFML package into your "Pip-Boy-Interface" folder.

4. Depending on your operating system and compiler, copy the appropriate SFML library files into your "Pip-Boy-Interface" folder. For example:

   - For GCC on Linux/macOS: Copy the "lib" folder from the extracted SFML package into your "Pip-Boy-Interface" folder.
   - For MSVC on Windows: Copy the "lib" folder from the extracted SFML package into your "Pip-Boy-Interface" folder. Then, copy the appropriate .dll files from the "bin" folder into your project's output directory (Debug or Release).

5. Update your project's build settings to include the necessary include and library paths. For example, in CMake, you can add the following lines to your CMakeLists.txt file:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(PipBoyInterface)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11)

include_directories(include)

if(MSVC)
    link_directories(lib)
endif()

add_executable(PipBoyInterface Pip-Boy.cpp)

if(MSVC)
    target_link_libraries(PipBoyInterface sfml-graphics-d sfml-window-d sfml-system-d)
else()
    target_link_libraries(PipBoyInterface sfml-graphics sfml-window sfml-system)
endif()
```

Now, you should be able to build and run your SFML-based Pip-Boy interface project.

(Me) so in my terminal how do i make SFML work on this project?

To build and run your SFML-based Pip-Boy interface project using the terminal, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to your "Pip-Boy-Interface" folder.

2. If you're using CMake, create a build directory and generate the project files:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

3. Build the project:

```bash
make
```

Or, if you're using MSVC:

```bash
cmake --build . --config Debug
```

4. Run the project:

```bash
./PipBoyInterface  # For Linux/macOS
Debug/PipBoyInterface.exe  # For Windows
```

If you're not using CMake, you can compile and link the project manually using the appropriate compiler flags and libraries. For example, using GCC on Linux/macOS:

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 -o PipBoyInterface Pip-Boy.cpp -Iinclude -Llib -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system
```

And for MSVC on Windows:

```bash
cl /EHsc /Iinclude Pip-Boy.cpp /link /LIBPATH:lib sfml-graphics-d.lib sfml-window-d.lib sfml-system-d.lib
```

Then, run the project:

```bash
./PipBoyInterface  # For Linux/macOS
PipBoyInterface.exe  # For Windows
```

Remember to replace "include" and "lib" with the appropriate paths to your SFML include and library directories.
