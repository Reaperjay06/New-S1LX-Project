(Me) so i have added the project to a folder name "Pip-Boy-Interface" do i add the SFML library to this folder?

Yes, you can add the SFML library to the "Pip-Boy-Interface" folder. Here's how you can do it:

1. Download the SFML library from https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.html. Choose the version that matches your operating system and compiler (GCC for Linux/macOS, MSVC for Windows).

2. Extract the downloaded SFML package.

3. Copy the "include" folder from the extracted SFML package into your "Pip-Boy-Interface" folder.

4. Depending on your operating system and compiler, copy the appropriate SFML library files into your "Pip-Boy-Interface" folder. For example:

   - For GCC on Linux/macOS: Copy the "lib" folder from the extracted SFML package into your "Pip-Boy-Interface" folder.
   - For MSVC on Windows: Copy the "lib" folder from the extracted SFML package into your "Pip-Boy-Interface" folder. Then, copy the appropriate .dll files from the "bin" folder into your project's output directory (Debug or Release).

5. Update your project's build settings to include the necessary include and library paths. For example, in CMake, you can add the following lines to your CMakeLists.txt file:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(PipBoyInterface)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11)

include_directories(include)

if(MSVC)
    link_directories(lib)
endif()

add_executable(PipBoyInterface Pip-Boy.cpp)

if(MSVC)
    target_link_libraries(PipBoyInterface sfml-graphics-d sfml-window-d sfml-system-d)
else()
    target_link_libraries(PipBoyInterface sfml-graphics sfml-window sfml-system)
endif()
```

Now, you should be able to build and run your SFML-based Pip-Boy interface project.

(Me) so in my terminal how do i make SFML work on this project?

To create a directory for your project in the terminal, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal.

2. Navigate to the parent directory where you want to create the new directory. For example, if you want to create a directory called "Pip-Boy-Interface" in your home directory, you would first navigate to your home directory:

```bash
cd ~
```

3. Then, create the new directory:

```bash
mkdir Pip-Boy-Interface
```

4. Verify that the directory was created:

```bash
ls
```

You should see "Pip-Boy-Interface" listed among the other directories in your home directory.

5. Navigate to the new directory:

```bash
cd Pip-Boy-Interface
```

Now, you can start working on your project in this directory.
